## Reading the images

- Layouts correspond to `detailed`, `compact`, and `single_line` in card YAML.
- Individual cards are 420 CSS pixels wide, captured at a 2x pixel ratio.
- Single-line layouts hide the heading and show one row per list item or summary.
- The examples use one account, the default name action (`none`), and data
  freshness disabled. The main guide shows the optional freshness footer.
- All five fictional games have their own illustration. The planet in Beyond the
  Blue covers the rear half of its ring.
- Images come from the local preview. Rendering them makes no Steam requests.
